# Maple Neopixel Clock

The goal with this clock project was to learn how to use vcarve and a Shapeoko 3 milling machine.

The electronics are from spare parts I had (I'm sure better components could be found) and the code is quickly put together to make it work but is by no means considered nice or finished.

Finally the PCB was designed to be able to plug a chronodot with an arduino nano and 3 neopixel rings and 2 buttons. I could (probably should?) have chained the rings instead of connecting them separately but didn't think about it when I designed it.

This project is unlikely to evolve or change much :)
